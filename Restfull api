10. Server will not take the manual port number so we have to give the process number with condition of OR operator like below:
	--> process.env.PORT || (write your port number).
11. See that your connection is successful or not? by consoling the port connection.
12. Make a folder for database and a file name connection.js in that folder.
13. Connect mongoose with database with the localhost and port number 27017 with your DB name at the end.
